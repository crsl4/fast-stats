This folder contains the source code for all the web apps in the WI Fast Stats website:

- Code for the `cotyledon` web app is in the `webinar-aug20` folder
- Code for the `ecosystem` web app is in the `webinar-dec20` folder
- Code for the `introBio152` web app is in the `webinar-bio153` folder

The other two files correspond to internal developer notes (not important for users of the web apps).
